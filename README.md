ASP.NET Core: Building scalable and efficient web APIs.

Logging: Implementing logging mechanisms to track API activities.

Working with Models: Structuring and managing data models.

Postman: Testing API endpoints and automating API requests.

Entity Framework Core: Performing database operations with ORM.

Software Architecture: Designing a clean and modular architecture for maintainability.

NLog Implementation: Integrating NLog for efficient logging.

Global Error Handling: Managing exceptions and providing meaningful error responses.

AutoMapper: Streamlining data transformations between models and DTOs.

Content Negotiation: Enabling APIs to support different response formats.

Validation: Ensuring data integrity with input validation mechanisms.

Asynchronous Code: Enhancing performance with async programming techniques.

Action Filters: Customizing request processing with filters.

Pagination: Implementing pagination for large datasets.

Filtering: Applying filters to retrieve specific data.

Searching: Enabling search functionality within API endpoints.

Sorting: Implementing sorting mechanisms for ordered data retrieval.

Data Shaping: Customizing API responses for flexibility.

HATEOAS: Implementing hypermedia-driven API interactions.

HEAD and OPTIONS Methods: Supporting additional HTTP methods for enhanced API usability.

Root Documentation: Structuring API documentation for better accessibility.

Versioning: Managing multiple API versions effectively.

Caching: Optimizing performance with caching strategies.

Rate Limit and Throttling: Controlling API access and request rates.

JWT, Identity, and Refresh Token: Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.

API Documentation: Documenting API endpoints using Swagger/OpenAPI.
